  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.

        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.
    - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

/*
  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. The global binding principle is when "this" is not defined. This is a mistake and will by default reference the window or global object in node.
  2. The implicit binding principle is when "this" is referencing a particular object. This occurs when the function is called with a dot prior to the function. The object to the right of the dot is "this".
  3. The new binding principle is when we are using a constructor function to create a new object. "this" refers to the specific object being created by the constructor function.
  4. The explicit binding principle is when .call or .apply functions are used to invoke a constructor function. "this" then refers to the new object being created by the constructor function.
